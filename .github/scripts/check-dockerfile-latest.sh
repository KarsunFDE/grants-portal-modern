# 4 Dockerfiles still pin to :latest tags:
#   services/api-gateway/Dockerfile
#   services/grant-application-service/Dockerfile
#   services/peer-review-service/Dockerfile
#   frontend/Dockerfile (uses :latest twice — node + nginx)
#
# Exception: services/ai-orchestrator/Dockerfile was hand-pinned to
# python:3.11-slim in 2026-Q1 — teaching artefact, not under lockfile guard.
#
# While debt 11 is locked: at least one of those 4 Dockerfiles still says
# :latest. Exit 1.
# When debt 11 is modernized (W4-Wed): all 4 pinned. Exit 0.
