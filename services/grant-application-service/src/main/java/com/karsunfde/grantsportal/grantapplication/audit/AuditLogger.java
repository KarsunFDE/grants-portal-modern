/**
 * Audit logger.
 *
 * ⚠ DELIBERATE — Item 2 in docs/brownfield-debt.md ⚠
 *
 * {@code recordAsync} is the only path callers use. It runs on Spring's
 * default async executor — which means:
 *
 *   1. The HTTP response is flushed BEFORE the audit row is written
 *      (the controller returns; the async task runs on a separate thread).
 *   2. There is NO {@code @Transactional} on the async path — even if the
 *      caller is inside a transaction, this lives outside it.
 *   3. If the service crashes between flush and async-write, the audit row
 *      is lost forever. The CRUD operation succeeded, but there's no
 *      audit-trail evidence of it.
 *
 * Cohort finds this in W3 multi-agent HITL audit-trail work + W5 Wed AIOps
 * governance via a crash-drill.
 *
 * What "fixed" looks like:
 *   - Synchronous + transactional write in the same boundary as the CRUD op
 *     (transactional outbox preferred so external-system audit sinks stay
 *     consistent).
